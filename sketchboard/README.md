Some Modifications:
1. When click on "create", it will create a new object of canvases and save to the database.
2. When you click on a selected canvas, it will fetch the id and load the specific pixels to your screens.
3. When you add a new canvas, it will be displayed on the home page.
4. Optimize several algorithms and functions.
5. The models are updated.

Some Modifications:
1. The scibble part is added. I make comments for my part.
2. Because I want to make the database add a new canvas object when I click on create, I make changes to the create "button" in base.html. Please have a look and maybe fix the style.
3. When you create a new canvas, it's a little bit slow. We can figure it out later.
4. When you are on the board.html, the first time you click on scribble, it's a little bit slow so that the GUI may seems strange for a second. I suppose it's still not a big problem for now.
5. On the board.html, the sliders and the relavant tests("red", "green", "blue") do not show correctly. Please fix that part. Thank you!
6. I edit the model. Please see the comments.

Thank you for your help! Let's move on to next step!
